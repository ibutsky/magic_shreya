Project Descriptions: 

Name: exoplanets
Necessary libraries: python, numpy, matplotlib
Main Program: ExoPlanets.py
Description: Estimates the size of a transiting exoplanet from real K2 data. 
The program asks the user to pick a number id of the data (see possible options in
exoplanets/data) and shows a plot of the flux as a function of time of that star. 
The user then chooses the start and end time of the brightness dip an exoplanet makes. 
The program finds the depth of that dip and converts that into an estimate of the radius
of the planet.


Name: stars
Necessary libraries: python, jupyter/ipython notebooks, numpy, matplotlib, astropy, sep
Main Programs: Make color image.ipynb, Photometry part 1 and 2 ipython notebooks
Description: Jupyter notebook tutorial of how to make images and study stellar properties
from Hubble data. Original tutorial by Meredith Durbin https://github.com/meredith-durbin/cmd_project/
"Make color image" makes a composite color image of a globular cluster using red and blue filtered data. 
Photometry notebooks find the brightness and locations of the stars in the data and make
a Herzsprung-Russel Diagaram of the data.
